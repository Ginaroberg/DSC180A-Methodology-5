**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**<br>
The most interesting topic we've covered has been the potential to predict various climate variables.  I found predicting surface temperature, surface humidity, and precipitation to be some of the most interesting as those are aspects that impact our daily lives and we experience these changes regularly.  

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br>
A potential investigation I might be interested in pursuing is pretraining a CNN model.  There is limited data for us to use.  As a result, the current model often underpredicts.  A potential solution would be adding a pretraining step in order to improve the models performance in making predictions. We could conduct pretraining using the pi control data set or the 4 x CO2 scenario.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
A potential change in my approach would be to keep better track of the changes in the model's performance.  Since the model takes about an hour to fit, I often have to run it and then check its performance later on after.  There could be a better way to assess each version of the model and document its performance, rather than having to go back and check for each version.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
I would be interested in trying other models and comparing their performance with the CNN I currently have.  There could also be differences in how the models perform depend on the task and the variable that it is predicting.  Since we have a group, it will be interesting to compare our results and see how the other models perform.  Currently, I have only tried the CNN.
